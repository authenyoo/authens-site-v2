      <description><![CDATA[hahha.... long time no see...
<p>if you haven't noticed, recently i dropped a <a href="https://ipgrabber.bandcamp.com/album/authensmoulder">producer rapper collab album with dope shit</a> (his artist name is cracksmoulder, but i'll call him dope shit from now on)</p>
<p>do i think it is good? kind of</p>
<p>but... mashing together the genres experimental hip hop, noise, sound collage, ambient, atmospheric drum and bass, breakcore, chopped and screwed, industrial hip hop, pluggnb, midi music into this chaotic, raw and quirky 10 minute album was extremely fun and had some moments that turned out... actually listenable and good?</p>
<p>me and dope shit watching skibidi toilet gender swap and garten of banban annoying orange gaming was the funniest shit ever and turned into probably my best album</p>
<p>"lord forgive me, cause i fw u heavy ❤️" is one of the most chaotic ones on the album and turned out to be (in my opinion) my best song</p>
<p>"this nigga authen needs to stop using leroy snares" is probably the funniest in the whole album. this stupid fucking leroy snare bit and the "weee are the leroyyy snares" part is actually so funny to me</p>
<p>i experimented a lot with chopping and screwing in this album, which probably was the worst part</p>
<p>my chopping and screwing kinda sucked tbh, especially in "shout out 2 tha drainers"</p>
<p>also randomly</p>
<p>list of samples and people that can sue me and dope shit:</p>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">
<li>ericdoa - 2008</li>
<li>drowing pool - bodies</li>
<li>radiohead - 15 step midi</li>
<li>ghostbusters theme midi</li>
<li>technically amen break but no one cares no one has ever cleared an amen break</li>
<li>that one video of quinn where shes like im bladee drain gang</li>
<li>ihascupquake - mineblox (the one with you were always playing roblox)</li>
<li>SODA BY GLEN (PROD TREKYO &amp; 7VENLYVES) *SLEEPINGTETSUO MIX*</li></ul>
<p>yeah thats basically all i wanted to say</p>
<p>check out the <a href="https://authensmoulder.neocities.org/">authensmoulder website</a> it got links to stuff its cool its comic sans</p>
<p>as of me writing this, authensmoulder is not on streaming, but it soon will. stay tuned!!!</p>]]></description>
